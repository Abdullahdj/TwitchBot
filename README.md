# TwitchBot
Twitch bot for a temporary twitch channel we ran.
* Twitch bot communicates with IRC chat from Twitch to allow users to communicate with bot
* Has some custom commands
* Has functionality to display socials links after a fixed period of time
* As a proof of concept a nuaghts and crosses game was added that chat users could use to play against each other
* Threading used to allow for both checking how much time has elapsed (for timed commands) and to wait for messages simultaniously
